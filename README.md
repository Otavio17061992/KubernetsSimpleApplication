# KubernetsSimpleApplication
This project demonstrates the orchestration of a full-stack application environment using Kubernetes.
It features a decoupled architecture consisting of a web application and a persistent database, managed locally via Minikube.

The goal of this project is to implement core Kubernetes concepts, including:

    Deployment & Scaling: Managing application lifecycles and replicas.

    Service Discovery: Enabling communication between the app and the database using internal ClusterIPs.

    Persistence: Implementing PersistentVolumes (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC) to ensure data durability.

    Configuration Management: Using ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment variables and credentials.
